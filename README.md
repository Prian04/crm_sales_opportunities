# Transforming CRM Data into Actionable Insights

Analyzing CRM data is crucial for driving strategic business decisions. This project leverages a dataset from @MavenAnalytics to uncover actionable insights from sales opportunities. Using structured data from multiple CSV files, relationships between accounts, products, sales pipelines, and sales teams were mapped, enhanced with custom deal stage and date tables, and transformed into a user-friendly interactive dashboard.

## Problem Statement
Sales teams often struggle to derive actionable insights from scattered and unstructured CRM data. The goal of this project was to:
* Integrate and organize CRM data.

* Identify and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

* Enable decision-makers to interact with the data through dynamic visualizations and filters.

## Metrics & Insights
Key performance metrics calculated from the data include:
* **Total Revenue:** $10.01M
* **Deals Won:** 4,238
* **Deals Lost:** 2,473
* **Average Sales Cycle Length:** 47.99 days
  
These metrics provide insights into revenue trends, sales performance, and the efficiency of the sales pipeline.

## Data Preparation
The project involved merging and cleaning data from multiple sources:
1) CSV Files: Accounts, products, sales pipelines, and sales teams.
2) Custom Tables:
* Deal Stages
* Comprehensive Date Table
3) Relationships and Cardinality: Meticulously mapped to ensure seamless integration between tables.

## Visualizations
The following dynamic visualizations were created to represent the data effectively:
1) Pie Chart: Highlighting the proportion of deals in various stages (Closed, Engage, Lost, Prospecting).
2) Column Chart: Showing the number of leads by product.
3) Map Visualization: Representing total revenue by regional offices.
4) Bar Chart: Displaying individual sales revenue.

Interactive Features:

* Slicers: Filter data by sales agent and quarter/year to enable drill-down into specific insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the power of structured CRM data in revealing key business insights. By visualizing KPIs and leveraging interactive tools, decision-makers can:
* Monitor revenue and sales performance effectively.
* Identify bottlenecks in the sales pipeline.
* Strategically align resources to improve sales outcomes.

## Tools Used
* Data Source: Maven Analytics
* Visualization: Power BI / Excel (as applicable)
* Techniques: Data modeling, cardinality mapping, and interactive dashboard creation.
